Build Rock Paper Scissors With Classes;


~ How many views/pages will there be?
~ What classes to use, is Game & Player enough?
~ How will I implement sessions in the app.rb?
~ Make sure I right tests, start with this first, test drive the thing!
~ From previous challenge Battle,  heck how the use of a global variable (Bad idea irw) effects the game?

# Use model/controller set up. Will need a lib folder for class files. This means keep logic in the class aka models and less code in the controller aka app.rb file.  



1. Go to / and present user with username box and greeting - x
2. When player name is entered, do something ~ a redirect? To a page greeting the player with Hello #{player.name} - x
3. Implement a player class that creates itself using the playername captured from index page params. - x
4. Implement a game class that takes a player as arg and can return that players name. - x
5. Create a web helper that will auto fill a name in the html form



Class Game

  def initiliaze(Player) #probably only takes one player as arg for now, the other player is the computer...
    @player1 = player1
  end

end


~ Need to consider which class stores the move? Probably the main game class.

Class Player

  def initiliaze(name)
    @name = name
  end

end


The game logic;


if @player_move && @player_name && @player_name != ""
  moves = {
    "rock" => "scissors",
    "paper" =>  "rock",
    "scissors" => "paper"
    } 

  @computers_move = ["rock", "paper", "scissors"].sample

    if @player_move == @computers_move %>
        "#{@player_name} played #{@player_move} and the computer also played #{@computers_move}. We have a draw"

    elsif moves[@player_move] == @computers_move
        "#{@player_name} wins! The computer played #{moves[@player_move]}. #{@player_name} played #{@player_move}!"
    else
        Computer wins!
      end
end
